# Associative-MAPS-using-BST

## ASSOCIATIVE MAPS
Associative Maps or Tree Maps are an important data structure that have many uses in real-world. Conceptually, Map is a data structure that consists of are collection of key and value pairs. In a map, the key values are generally used to sort and uniquely identify the elements, while the mapped values store the content associated to this key.

## Functionalities
### a) Insert: 
Provide Recursive as well as Iterative Insert function. The Insert function will insert a given value in
BST. Incase value already exist then it should return false and do not insert.
### b) Delete: 
Provide Recursive as well as Iterative Delete function. The delete function will delete the node with
given key. Incase key does not exist then it should return false. Your code will perform deletion by copy.
### c) LookUp: 
Provide Recursive as well as Iterative function to find if the record with the given Key exists.
### d) Print: 
Print the records in BST, sorted by the key. You will provide two versions of the print
    i. Recursive
    ii. Iterative using stack.
### e) Duplicate: 
A function to create a copy of the BST.
### f) Node_Count: 
Give a function to count the number of nodes in the tree.
### g) T * LargerValues (T value): 
This function will return an array consisting of all the values larger than the given value in sorted order. So, in case of BST of products. It will return all the products with id greater than the given product id.
### h) Load: 
create a BST from a file data. The file will consist of ID, Name and Quantity.
